This project is a Movie Recommendation System designed to suggest relevant movies to users based on similarity and preferences. The system analyzes movie-related data and generates personalized or content-based recommendations to enhance user discovery and engagement.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how recommendation engines work in real-world applications using structured datasets and machine learning techniques.
# Features
Recommends movies based on similarity metrics
Processes and analyzes movie metadata
Efficient filtering and ranking of recommendations
Scalable design for extending to larger datasets
Simple and easy-to-understand implementation
# Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
Data Handling: CSV-based datasets
# How It Works
Movie data is loaded and preprocessed to extract relevant features such as genres, descriptions, or metadata.
Feature vectors are created using text or numerical representations.
A similarity algorithm (such as cosine similarity) is applied to measure how closely movies are related.
Based on user input or a selected movie, the system identifies and ranks similar movies.
The top results are returned as recommendations.
